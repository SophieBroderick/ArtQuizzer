## Background
When I was studying for my Art History exam I wanted to use a tool to test my knowledge but there was none available. It was hard to memorize all the information throughout the year and still be able to recall everything for the final exam at the end of the year. I started collecting the information into a spreadsheet and it led to the idea of developing an application. I thought that an easy to use tool with a nice design could help students learn but also be appreciated by any art enthusiasts. Generally, I am passionate about promoting art through the use of technology.
